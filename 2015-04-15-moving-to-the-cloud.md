### Lorem Ipsum Dolar Sit Ahmet

So the thing is, I used cloud9.io and other stuff only to realiz that if I'm on a Mac environment clodifying my life
might be easier than that.

Webstorm did not work well, it tried to index remote files like crazy and it caused problems over SSH.

I am using "Luxi Mono" as a font, it's one of the rares serif fixed-width fonts; it gives the best of both worlds, and it's doing its job really well.

For instance, I can edit this files as if they are on my local file system (tehre are open source alternatives;
however, I choose to use Transmit --- it is awesome, worth every penny)

So when I edit something it's already live.

One good thing is I don't care about typography, as Jekyll is handling that for me.

Sometimes saving can be slow. that's due to changing network etc I guess.

I also can ssh that's no big deal.

On tablet I use panic coda, it has terminal, it has a decent editor, and it works brilliantly. --- I don't understand
 all the negative reviews on the app store; it does its job well.

One problem is that what I write will not be typographically accurate. --- Is that a problem? Not really. Since jekyll already handles that, it's not a big issue. --- A bigger issue is

So how do I solve my needs?

operating system?

Learning to be frugal.

Apple keyboard is "beautiful" and I don't need to be a master typist anyway; and it also leaves a lot of space on my dekstop. --- That should be the future: I mean, the future is less cluttered, less clunky. --- The keyboards with tactile feedback, no matter how beautiful they are, are a thing of the past.

And I don't think it affects my typing speed that much anyways.

I still can type on the keyboard. ---

... And if it's "Apple" I am sure they have thought about the best layout, the ideal key spacing, why 4 degrees inclination is the best etc etc before even coming up with their initial prototype. --- Because they designed these Apple Wireless Keyboards when Steve Jobs was alive.

I really liked this luxi mono font;
It's serif; so it's more readable.
And and it's elegant.
It needs a little extra line height; however, I can live with it :)
