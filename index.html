    <h1>Hi I’m <strong>Volkan</strong></h1>

    <p><img title="Coffee is the answer ;)" alt="" src="/images/cf.png"></p>

    <p>I’m <a href="http://volkan.io">Volkan</a>, and this is the place I
    write<br>
    mostly about <strong>JavaScript</strong> techniques and best practices.</p>

    <p>You’ll also find articles around the topics:<br>
    <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>hacking</strong>,
    <strong>geekery</strong>,
    “the” <strong>cloud</strong>, and <strong>productivity</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote style="text-align:left;">

    <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>

    <p>I recently started <a
    href="https://leanpub.com/js-next"
    >writing a brand new book about <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the
    edge</a>. It’s about all the cool things that are coming up next in
    <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It’s a work in progress, <a
    href="https://leanpub.com/js-next"
    >you can register here to get notified when it is published</a>.</p>

    <p>Writing a book takes a great deal of time and energy. The downside of
    this is, I will have extremely limited time to write articles here. At least
    that will be the case until I complete the majority of the book.</p>

    <p>…</p>

    While on the topic of books, <a
    href="https://o2js.com/interview-questions/">have you read my book on
    <strong>JavaScript Interviews</strong></a>? — It’s a game-changer, and it’s
    not me who says that: it’s the readers of the book <strong>;)</strong>.</a>

    <h2>Articles</h2>

    <p>Here are the articles that I’ve written here so far:

    <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li>
        <h3>
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | replace:'.html',''}}"
            >{{ post.title }}</a>
                <span> ({{ post.updated | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }})</span>
        </h3>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <blockquote style="text-align:left;">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>

        <p><strong>The article list above is by no means complete</strong>.</p>

        <p>I’m moving older articles from other places, and the process
        is <em>a little <strong>slow</strong> and
        <strong>messy</strong></em>.</p>

        <!--Besides, this blog is under a constant rewriting process because
        technology, standards,
        conventions, and implementations <strong>change</strong> forever.
        Things that once were “best practices” can quickly become
        “antipatterns”.-->

        <p>Yet, <a href="https://archive.org/web/">thanks to the witches and
        wizards who’ve created the wayback machine</a>, once something becomes
        public, it never gets lost <strong>;)</strong></p>

        <p>So you might be interested in <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624151559/http://o2js.com/"
        >browsing the internet archives for even older versions of this
        blog</a>.</p>

        <p>You might also want to <a href="http://o2js.com/v1">browse the old site for the articles that I have not converted yet</a>.</p>

        <p>There is also <a
        href="https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com/tree/master/server/blog/markdown">a repository of articles</a> that have not been migrated yet.</p>

        <p>I know, I know <strong>:)</strong> — I'm trying to clean it up as my
        time permits.</p>

        <p><strong>Volkan</strong>.</p>
