## Introduction

When you have limited time, you can only put so much on your plate; this creates an instant anxiety and a feeling of guilt. You feel like you are not being committed to what you have promised to yourself.

To overcome this anxiety or this **paralysis by analysis** state of mind, you'll have to **sort out your priorities**. And to sort them out, you should know what is occupying your time in the first place --- You cannot optimize without measuring.

## The Methodology

To solve my "*Oh God, what should I be doing next to make the best use of my time?!*" problem, I grouped my projects into different buckets and sorted them.

> To clarify terminology, when I say "project", I look at it from a **[GTD][gtd]** perspective:
>
> Anything that takes more than one step to accomplish is a **project** for me.

I sorted all my projects in **four buckets**:

* **In Progress**:
    * These are the thing that I'm exerting a lot of efforts.
* **Almost Done**:
    * These require little effort to maintain, I just want to
keep an eye on them.
* **Backlog**:
    * These are the **candidates** to be done **next** when I can
take more **in progress** items.
* **Ice Box**:
    * These are the things that I probably won't be touching for a long time. --- They either provide little value, or there are wiser ways to allocate my time to more productive things.

Any item in the bucket can jump into any other bucket at any time depending on my current goals, plans, and interests.

So, without further ado, here's some of the side projects that I'm working on and their current states right now:

> Note that most of these are **open source**; feel free to fork them.

> Also, [feel free to send me an email][me] for your comments and suggestions.

## In Progres

> These are actively being developed; adding new features, fixing bugs, etc.

### Writing a Book About **JavaScript on the Edge**

> **TL;DR:**
>
> I'm writing a book, [you can go to the books website][js-next] to register your interest.

I was first thinking of writing a series of articles on this topic. As it turned out, the sheer amount of these yet-to-be-written articles was enough to fill the chapters of a book.

Then I said, "*Why not write a book instead?*"

A benefit from this approach is the fact that writing a book requires discipline. It forces you to be on the topic; whereas while writing articles on a blog, you can segue from the main storyline. --- **Focus** is good.

> You can present the topics in a much more organized and story-like way in a book.

Writing a book, however, requires a huge block of **time** and **Jedi concentration**.

As I was limited in these resources, I steered away from the idea of yet another book for a while.

I still don't have time, yet I'm motivated enough to make it. Which is what matters, because **motivation makes time**.

> "*[JavaScript on the Edge][js-next]*" is a practical book about cutting edge **JavaScript**:
>
> Instead of covering everything but the kitchen sink about the language, it focuses on the new:
>
> It will focus on the newly introduced features, modifications, and extensions.
>
> This book is not written up in the ivory towers. Hence, you won't see much "*hypothetical*" debate in it.
>
> It's quite the contrary: If you love getting your hands dirty, and if you love being on the edge, then you'll absolutely love this book.

[You can go to the books website][js-next] to register your interest in the book.

When that book is done I have quite a few follow-up book-related ideas:

* Converting current "*[JavaScript Interview Questions][jsiq]*" to markdown, and moving it to a place like [Leanpub][leanpub]
* JavaScript Interview Questions Deluxe Edition that dives deeper into technical details. The book will have extra interview question and answer examples.
* A book about practical uses of **JavaScript** **patterns**.

So there might be other books coming up too **;)**

### Sif

**[sif][sif]** is an intelligent curator that makes information meaningful and findable. --- It is [a command line utility][sif] that I use to organize my links.

> **Aside**
>
> It also happens that [**sif** is a Norse goddess][sif-wikipedia].

During my day-to-day work, I touch a substantial amount of links. I regularly collect, categorize, and **sift** those links.

After collecting such links for a while, I realized that it becomes harder to search your bookmarks after your browser's bookmark index grows above a few tens of megabytes. I also realized that my browser slowed down after my bookmark index file grew above a certain threshold.

> There are social bookmarking, and content sharing websites for this very purpose of organizing content. They, however, are slow to respond when compared to something that you can run locally. And you have to be online to be able to sort and update your bookmarks.

A **command-line interface** is the **fastest** that you'll ever get, and having a local copy of your index file is helpful.

Besides, since it's a plain text file, you can edit it with any editor: You won't need a fancy application, or a web interface to sift through your links.

[You can visit sif's **GitHub repository** to learn more about it][sif]. Contributions are always welcome, of course **;)**.

### Learning Stuff

As an engineer, you have to learn new things to expand your horizon; and I **love** learning new things. I don't know you, and learning something or figuring out how different pieces come together to form a solution is euphoric for me.

> **Learning** is a **lifestyle** --- **Learning** is **happiness**.

Actually if **learning** is not your **lifestyle**, and you are  **IT**, then maybe it's then maybe you should have been working in another sector **;)**.

Here are the things in my current queue that I study the most:

* [Elastic Search][elk]
* [OpenStack][openstack]
* [Swift][swift]

## Almost Done

> These are the **completed** projects that are "mature enough".
>
> I do retouches and minor fixes to them every once in a while.

### JavaScript Interview Questions

> **Aside**
>
> I'm planning to migrate this book to [Leanpub][leanpub] some time; it will be much easier to manage and update the book that way.
>
> Also, when it is published on [Leanpub][leanpub], it will also be much easier to engage with the book's audience.

**[JavaScript Interview Questions][jsiq]** is a book about **JavaScript Engineering** interviews and tips and tricks on how to prepare for them. Readers say that “JavaScript Interview Questions” really helped them ace their interviews.

**Version one** of the book is complete. I am thinking about writing a second extended version for a while. Besides that I'm also considering writing another --- a more technical --- ebook on **Modern JavaScript Best Practices**.

With two **demanding** little monsters (*i.e., kids :)*). Yet, I doubt it will be happening anytime soon **:)**.

[jsiq]: http://o2js.com/interview-questions

### volkan.io

[volkan.io][volkan] is a website that I put my bio, and a summary of what I did so far, what I'm interested in, etc.

Maybe I'll convert it to something more dynamic and shiny in the long run; the site as it's current state is "good enough".

[volkan]: http://volkan.io

### Sensei

**[Sensei][sensei]** is a minimal [Node.js][node] wrapper around the [sensu API][sensu].

It works as its current state; however, there's still a lot of room for improvement.

### Revolve

**[Revolve][revolve]** is a multi-process image rotator.

I doubt it has any practical value but who knows **:)**

I use it to change the background images of [volkan.io][volkan].

[revolve]: https://github.com/v0lkan/revolve

### Eagle Eye

**[Eagle Eye][eagle-eye]** analyzes your **npm** and **bower** dependencies creates a report of which of them are out of date.

[eagle-eye]: https://github.com/v0lkan/eagle-eye

### Steward

Have a sneaky cousin that uses your computer without permission?

Then **[steward][steward]** may be a solution for that **;)**.

Steward watches your desktop and emails you if anything changes on the screen.

> **[steward][steward]** Currently works on Mac computers only.

[steward]: https://github.com/v0lkan/steward

## Backlog

> The **backlog** contains candidates for the "next thing" to work on.
>
> Once I'm done with some of the things that I'm working on, I take items from here into my **in progress** bucket.
>
> The reverse is also true: If I feel like I have too much load in my **in progress** bucket, I put some of those items into the **backlog**.

### **o2js.com** Version 2

> **Aside**
>
> [As I started writing another book][js-next], I realized that I'm not finding enough time to work on this; so I moved it to the backlog instead.

It's this very website that you are reading right now.

I'm **converting** posts from the older site to here. I'm also **rewriting** older articles that I have removed from the site in the light of the current changes in the technological ecosystem.

The transformation of **o2js.com v2** is an **ongoing process**. And to complete it fast, obviously I should be adding more content to this blog faster.

The thing is: Writing a good article is an excruciatingly **slow** process.

It is not an easy task: It requires at least a couple of hours' **undivided attention**, and a couple of extra **days** to refine it.

So, for me at least, writing more than one technical article per week would not be possible without compromising quality.

I am targeting **one new article per month**, which realistically means that it will take  **forever** to finish this project **:)**.

If I can make more time, I will be focusing on this blog more.

> **Aside**
>
> There are tools and processes that I find helpful in managing my time to get things done fast.
>
> This is the topic of another article, I think **;)**.

### **EcmaScript2015**...ifying All The Things!

This includes all the projects that I've been working on, and also all the articles that I've written so far.

I already use **[EcmaScript 2015][es6]** in my new articles and projects. Yet, the older ones still need to be converted.

This is a **big** transformation that I have to do it gradually because if you're not using **[es2015][es6]** right now, then you are already lagging behind.

[es6]: http://es6-features.org/

### Pringles

**[Pringles][pringles]** generates static cached copies of dynamic **AJAX**-enable web pages. It does this by running the page in a **headless browser** and executing all the **JavaScript** to produce the final result. So the result will be **much more** than what a typical search engine would crawl.

The project is ready as a proof-of-concept. I've tested it on [wikiwand][wikiwand], which is a dynamic website that does not display too much content when you crawl without executing the **JavaScript** on it.

[Pringles][pringles] will be a part of [linkibol][linkibol]'s (*see below*) indexer.

I will be using it for the later versions of `sif`, along with some semantic processing logic, so that I can properly tag content.

### JFDI

**[jfdi][jfdi]**, in a nutshell, is a command line interface to help you focus what goals you will achieve **right now**.

Why? Because we geeks live in the terminal.

And using something that's already running and most of the time available in front of your eyes helps you **overcome the inertia** of launching a separate application just to manage your goals.

**[jfdi][jfdi]** is fast, and simple.

[You can read more on **the project's GitHub page**][jfdi].

## Ice Box

> The following are the projects that are in the **ice box**.
>
> That is to say, they **won't** be active for a **long** time.

### Board

> **Aside**
>
> After seen a few open source project on this topic, I've also decided to contribute to one of them instead of starting from scratch.

**[Board][board]** is a minimalistic and highly-scalable dashboard and monitoring app.

There are a lot of features to add; it's currently ready as a minimally viable solution. --- Feel free to [fork it][board].

I'm preparing a list of what cool features to implement next.

I'm also drafting a blog post about **[board]**'s implementation details, which I will be sharing soon, hopefully.

### Tosspick

A fun mobile game. --- It's a new adventure for me since I have not done game programming before.

There's nothing to show yet. And the project is **not** open source.

Nonetheless, I'm learning **a lot** in the meantime; and I hope to share them in further articles here.

### Snippets

**[Snippets][snippets]** is a project about gathering code snippets, and distributing them in shareable formats; at least it **will be** when it gets completed.

Currently, it only has a few code snippets in it grouped into folders.

Since there are alternative tools like [snipplr][sniplr], [github gists][gists], [bl.ocks.org][blocks], [codepen][codepen], [runnable][runnable], [tributary][tributary], [smipple][smipple], [devsnippets][devsnippets], and many more, it will not provide much value to reinvent the wheel unless it makes something different or bettter.

### Themes

**[Themes][themes]** was a repository that I was going to gather customized IDE themes and color schemes for my taste.

I realized, however, that the more I change development environments and operating  systems (*and I do that **a lot***) the more it was becoming harder to keep  things in sync.

Moreover, sometimes I had to write a colorscheme from scratch just because I was not able to find a similar one that was supported in the IDE by default.

So I decided to **let it go** too.

It's better to use a well-supported color scheme, and typeface that's available everywhere, instead of trying to re-adjust your setting every time you change your development environment.

> For the interested I am currently using [Tomorrow Night][tomorrow] theme, with [Fira Mono][fira] as my typeface.

### **o2.js** JavaScript Framework

The astute reader might have realized that there is a theme in here:

> To get more stuff done; I had to let more stuff go.

Letting go of **o2.js**, however, was one of the hardest of such decisions. Nevertheless, it had to be done; and it was the correct decision.

To explain why it's hard, [let me take you back to 2006][flashback]:

> Let us set the stage a bit:
>
> Back then, **jQuery** was not in the arena.
>
> **Table-based layouts** were the **recommended** way of building a web page;
>
> **Google** was **not** a dominant search engine yet, and **Netscape Navigator 4** was still a browser that you had to support along with **Internet Explorer 5** because they were owning the majority of the market.
>
> And **Opera** was just about to make their worst business blunder by demanding its users to **pay money** to remove ads from the browser.

It all started with (*now obsolete*) JavaScript framework **sardalya** that I'd created back then.

In one of those lovely days of 2006 [**sardalya** got listed as one of the best frameworks around][flashback].

I was not aware that **sardalya** was in such a good shape: I was using it for my day-to-day duties, and it was improving my productivity however I was not aware that it was making others' lifes better too. -- Nope, there was no **GitHub** back then either **;)**.

It was the first time I felt I had an impact that was bigger than myself. <br>
(*the second time I had such a feeling was [when I wrote a book](interview-questions).*)

Having seen what **sardalya** can turn out to be, and how everybody can benefit from it too, I decided to work further on it and make it **even better**.

...

For a couple of years, things went well.

On the long run, however, technology evolved and I had to phase out **sardalya**. I decided to copy relevant and useful parts of it to create a brand new framework: **[o2.js][o2js]** --- a framework that was created from the ashes of **sardalya**.

> **Aside**
>
> I'm a startup guy:
>
> I think fast, act fast, and never hesitate to break things.
>
> Tearing things down entirely, burning bridges, and having a fresh and better start has been the general theme of my life so far.
>
> Those transitions have often been painful and have taught me **a lot** that I could not have gained by attending to some biz school or reading a book.

That was the beginning of an endless series of rewrites of the same framework (*o2.js*).

At each rewrite things were **seemingly** getting better:

* The code was becoming more stable.
* New ideas were emerging.
* And I was happily integrating those ideas, adding bits and pieces to the framework...

Then I suddenly came to a realization:

> Everything around me was evolving faster and faster.
>
> **JavaScript**, too, was **not** an exception to that.
>
> Cycles and breakthroughs in the industry were getting more frequent.
>
> Ten years ago, there was something groundbreaking **every one or two years**.
>
> Now there was something new and groundbreaking **every couple of months**.

If you are one of the lucky (*unlucky?*) people to have lived through the **JavaScript** revolution, and the **browser wars**; if there was no **Google** when you started hacking for the web, then you probably see the **geometric acceleration** of the evolution of technology just like I do.

...

Even if we skipped the rapid evolution of languages, frameworks, and technologies aside, **[o2.js][o2js]** in an of itself was growing out of control:

It was turning into a **monolith** that was trying to solve many things at once.

And the bigger the framework got, the harder it had become to **document**, **test**, and **maintain** it.

And when something new (*you name it: web components, HTML5 local storage, ServiceWorker, Node.JS, EcmaScript 2015...*) emerged, I had to readjust the entire monolithic codebase to take the emergent technology into account.

> Soon I found myself in the world of generators, transpilers, workers, linters, parsers just to be able to support the framework's day-to-day development.

If **[o2.js][o2js]** was a single module with a well-defined purpose --- such as a local storage helper, or an **AMD** variant, or a **Promise** implementation, or an animation library, etc. --- things could have been easier.

> One thing that hit me like a full speed freight train was the fact that trying to solve many things at once was not the way to go.
>
> **[Unix philosophy][unix-philosophy]** was time-tested and proven for a reason:
>
> I should be doing one thing at a time, and doing that thing **well**.

Trying to manage a monolith that does all the things, in this rapid (r)evolution was exhausting, time-consuming, counter-productive and **unsustainable**.

Long story short, effective today, I'm ceasing any active development on **[o2.js][o2js]**.

I will still be using parts of its codebase to solve problems.

Those solutions, however, will be much more **focused**:

They will have single, focused, and unique purposes; and they will be serving that purpose **well**.

### Writing "Writing Style Guide"s

> This topic deserves a separate article on its own; I'll start drafting it out here anyway **:)**:

I had started creating a few style guides for both writing code, and also for technical writing. I was using them as a reference for coding conventions in my side projects, as well as a reference for stylistic conventions in my articles.

At this point, an obvious question you might ask is:

> Why write your own style guides instead of using some of the already established ones?

Obviously people have been pondering on these issues a lot, so why not follow their piece of mind, instead of reinventing the wheel?

And when I asked this to myself, I realized that the answer is complicated and it lies deep within: It's because of my  obsession to control, categorize, organize everything.

> So even if my way of doing things is slightly different than the community guidelines, they were supposed to be signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.

Ir's the same obsession with "the ideal programming font family" and "the ideal color scheme". It is useful to a certain extent, yet it becomes detrimental when you start caring about those kinds of things too much. --- So the resolution is again to **let it go**.

Keeping an eye on everything requires a great deal of **attention**, **concentration**, and **bookkeeping**. You give permission to yourself to let go of things so that you could focus on more important stuff.

> [Resistance was futile][vogon]. I **had to** learn to let things go.
>
> To clarify further:
>
> Spending time on anything just for the sake of self-satisfaction while that thing does not provide any real value "at all" is a time lost that could have been utilized in better ways.

Keeping everything "organized" was also my obsession (*as well as many geeks, with similar mindsets, I believe :)*).

> I've realized that the more you learn to **let things go**, the more **productive** you become.

It's true not only for style guides but also for any strict rule that you impose upon the way you do things.

I have realized (**ahem**... *after ten or so years*) that it all boils down to **consistency**.

...

Documenting every minuscule detail about how to write an article, or how to author a piece of code is a **futile effort**.

And the more excruciatingly-detailed that guide becomes, the slower your writing will be because you will be trying harder and harder to conform every single rule written in the guideline.

> Being **consistent** is better than being **conformant**.
>
> **Perfection is boring**:
>
> It consumes your time, and your mental resources
> without giving enough value in return.

Besides, there are already very good style guides out there; it'd be wiser to stick with them. And about punctuation and grammar, there are resources like...;

* [The punctuation guide][punc]
* [Grammarly Handbook][grammarly]
* [Grammar Girl][grammar-girl]
* [This little guide to grammar and writing][ccc]
* [This little OWL][owl]
* [Daily writing tips][tips]
* And, the last but not the least, [this grammar monster][monster]

For writing, I follow the above links (*in priority order*) and do it my way, if I disagree with them.

For code style [idiomatic JS][idiomatic], and, again, I do it my way if I am not aligned with anything in there.

...

At the end of the day, **your writing is your style**; it is --- kind of --- your "signature":

The more you write, the more **consistent** it will get.

And most of the guides listed above, are just "guidelines" as their name imply; they are recommendations because there cannot be one true way of writing.

As your personality changes, so does your signature.

As your personality changes, your writing style changes too.

Trying to document something that constantly changes, ironically, will prevent it from changing.

> Standardizing things limits the way you explore your environment.
>
> It *can* even be detrimental to your improvement, growth, and development.
>
> Don't be a rock that is conformant and restrictive.
>
> Always have a *mind like water*: **Be consistent, and adaptive**.
