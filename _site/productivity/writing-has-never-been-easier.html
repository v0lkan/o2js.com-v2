<blockquote>
  <p>After experimenting with many different approaches, I’ve settled with my ideal writing workflow.</p>

  <p>It took “<em>a lot</em>” of trial and error, yet it’s simple enough to be a “<em>no brainer</em>”.</p>

  <p>And that’s what matters the simpler it is, the easier it will be to internalize.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="i-fucking-love-writing">I Fucking Love <strong>Writing</strong></h2>

<p>I write <strong>a lot</strong>, and I love it: There’s an inherent satisfaction in sharing what you know with an audience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So far…</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://o2js.com/interview-questions/">I’ve written a book about JavaScript interviews</a>,</li>
    <li>I’m in the process of writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/js-next">yet another one about the upcoming version of the language</a>,</li>
    <li>I’ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624151559/http://o2js.com/" title="o2js.com on the Wayback Machine">written quite a few articles</a> on this blog,</li>

    <li>I have done technical editing of several books,</li>
    <li>I’ve written a dozen of guest blog posts, authored technical articles…</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>There are literally <strong>hundreds of</strong> drafts, sitting in my cloud drive, waiting to be finalized and <strong>published</strong>.</p>

<p>If all these are not enough, <a href="http://goinswriter.com/500-words/" title="Write 500 words per day, every day">I write at least 500 words every day</a> too.</p>

  <p><strong>Writing</strong> frees my mind off of things, inspires me, and reveals ideas that I haven’t realized that I had.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>When you write orders of magnitude more than an average Joe, your writing and publishing <strong>process</strong> becomes really important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be as efficient, and as effective as possible, you’ll need to squeeze every bit of creative time you can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A successful writing workflow is what makes this happen:</p>

<p>It makes you forget about the process and focus on what’s important (<em>i.e., writing</em>).</p>

<p>The perfect workflow is the one that’s the <strong>easiest to habitualize</strong>. And to easily habitualize something, you’ll want <strong>the least amount of friction</strong> between you and the task you are going to do.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <a href="http://keysleft.com/" title="How many keystrokes have you left?">you have a limited amount of keystrokes left</a>, and you should, to the best of your ability, <strong>make them count</strong>.</p>

<p>My former writing setup was far from ideal for reducing friction.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ll be discussing next.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-galaxy-far-far-away">In a Galaxy Far Far Away…</h2>

<p>A long time ago, I was writing my articles with the help of my <em>home-baked</em> <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com/tree/e91edd205580bdce95dc7e36a0adc46a06dab2ed" title="A custom generator that uses MongoDB, and node.js — just to create a static website.">static blog generator</a>.</p>

<p>And for a while, it was good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was using my own “<em>creation</em>”.</p>

  <p>I knew it from inside out so that I could tweak it however I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that regard, the generator was doing its job pretty well. There was a tiny problem, however:</p>

<p>My workflow was too <strong>complicated</strong>, to say the least:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(1)</strong> I had to <code>ssh</code> and start a remote server;</li>
  <li>Login that server’s website;</li>
  <li>Write my article(s);</li>
  <li>Stop the remote server;</li>
  <li>Run a <em>publish script</em> on the server;</li>
  <li>Check the live published page;</li>
  <li>If I need to update the article, fix a typo, etc., then <strong>GOTO (1)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When any of my articles got closer and closer to their final state, they went through this <em>vicious cycle</em> over and over again. — It was like a never-ending nightmare:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was always “one last thing” to be rewritten, “one last typo” to be fixed, and it meant to start the above sequence… as if it would never end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know you, and that feels <strong>exhaustive</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="writing-should-be-fun">Writing Should Be Fun</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Writer%27s_block" title="Writer's block&quot; is just one of the many problems a writer has to deal with."><strong>Writing</strong>, in and of itself, is hard enough</a>, there’s no need to make it, kind of, like torture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing should be fun. And to make it fun, I’d prefer to…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open my favorite editor;</li>
  <li>Have a <strong>preview</strong> of the result (<em>i.e., the blog</em>) post as I type;</li>
  <li>And never bother publishing because the entire publish cycle is <strong>automated</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing has to be as <strong>hassle-free</strong>, as <strong>seamless</strong>, and as <strong>frictionless</strong> as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="to-reinvent-or-not-thats-the-problem">To Reinvent or Not… That’s the Problem</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.geekli.st/post/111932989787/grab-your-chisel-and-start-pounding-a-guest" title="Grab Your Chisel and Start Pounding">I’m an avid believer of “<strong>wheel reinvention</strong>”</a> because reinventing the wheel teaches you <strong>a lot</strong>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hacking</strong>, <strong>tweaking</strong>, and <strong>replicating</strong> existing solutions helps you see relationships between various components: Relationships that you thought never existed. This insight helps you come up with <strong>newer</strong> and <strong>better</strong> outcomes. This is <em><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Creativity" title="Creativity --- Wikipedia">the very definition of creativity</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since my existing setup was far from actualizing this dream, I decided to come up with a new workflow.</p>

<h2 id="reinventing-the-blogging-workflow">Reinventing the Blogging Workflow</h2>

<p>The question was not whether to reinvent; it was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is the <strong><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Opportunity_cost" title="Opportunity Cost --- Wikipedia">opportunity cost of the time I spend</a></strong> reinventing a static blog engine worth it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, in other words: “<em>Is there a more productive way to occupy my time?</em>”</p>

<p>Answering this <em>fundamental</em> question helped me to see what I was missing:</p>

<p>Instead of patching my hacky static content generator, I had to <strong>reinvent my writing workflow</strong> from the bottom up.</p>

<p>And so did I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my current setup, I just keep on writing. And everything is synchronized. — It’s just like <strong>magic</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curious? Let’s explore.</p>

<h2 id="the-editor">The <strong>Editor</strong></h2>

<p>Before I move on, here is some background information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I take the train (<em>Caltrain</em>) to work, and I have a total of two hours commute time daily.</li>
  <li>I love to write during this time on my laptop (<em>indeed that’s one of the few productive things that I can do on the train</em>).</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://uniquehazards.com/post/670577460/a-caltrain-showdown-verizon-vs-sprint">LTE on Caltrain sucks</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>…</p>

<p>Where was I? Yes, <strong>editors</strong>.</p>

<p>Your editor is an important part of the flow because… well… you spend the majority of your publishing time writing things on it.</p>

<h2 id="atomatom-is-my-precious"><strong><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">Atom</a></strong> Is My Precious</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>After trying a lots editors, I settled on <strong><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">atom</a></strong> as my editor of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s my current setup for <strong><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">atom</a></strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use <strong><a href="https://github.com/jenssegers/spacegray-monokai">Spacegray Monokai</a></strong> as my <strong>UI theme</strong>.</li>
  <li>I use <strong><a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">Base 16 Tomorrow Dark</a></strong> as my <strong>syntax theme</strong>.</li>
  <li>I use <strong><a href="http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragmatapro.htm" title="Pragmata Font Family">Essential PragmataPro</a></strong>, <strong>14px</strong>, with <strong>1.5</strong> line spacing as my <strong>font</strong>. — It’s a perfect monotype font with a price tag equal to a nice dinner out in the city. And yes, it’s <strong>totally worth it</strong>; it maintains its clarity even in smaller sizes.</li>
  <li>I use the <strong><a href="https://atom.io/packages/typewriter" title="Atom typewriter plugin">typewriter plugin</a></strong>, so I can write my stuff without getting distracted by the clutter.</li>
  <li>I use the <strong><a href="https://atom.io/packages/zen" title="Zen: Distraction-Free Writing">zen plugin</a></strong> for <em>focused writing</em> and <em>typewriter scrolling</em>.</li>
  <li>I use the <strong><a href="https://atom.io/packages/minimap" title="Minimap: A preview of the full source code.">minimap plugin</a></strong> to give a visual indicator of where I am in the text that I’m writing.</li>
  <li>I <em>soft wrap</em> the text at <strong>80 characters</strong> (<em>there’s a reason those <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Punched_card">punched cards</a> had 80 holes in them — it turns out to be <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">the ideal character length for a readable text</a></em>).</li>
  <li>I also <em>hide the editor tabs</em>, because I don’t need them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="three-pane-layout">Three Pane Layout</h2>

<p>Additionally, I split my view in three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the <strong>left</strong>, I have the text that I’m writing,</li>
  <li>On the <strong>right</strong>, I have a preview that automatically regenerates itself,</li>
  <li>And at the <strong>bottom</strong>, I keep a separate copy of the text that I’m editing. — That’s helpful in case I want to search for a word, or edit some other part of the article, I don’t want to lose the editing point I’m at.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how the overall setup looks like (<em>tap the image for a larger view</em>):</p>

<p><a href="https://o2js.com/images/editor-setup-large.png"><img src="https://o2js.com/images/editor-setup-sm.png" title="Here is how it looks like" class="centered" /></a></p>

<h2 id="post-processing">Post-Processing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>No writing is complete until it’s triple-reviewed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, no writing is complete <strong>at all</strong> because writing is an <em>ongoing</em> <strong>process</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[1]</strong> You iterate and reiterate over the text to <strong>rephrase</strong>, <strong>simplify</strong>, and <strong>clarify</strong> it.</li>
  <li>Then you review it once more for <strong>spelling errors</strong> and <strong>grammatical mistakes</strong>.</li>
  <li>Then you stay away from the text for a while. This helps you to <strong>clear</strong> your mind off of it. This step is <strong>fundamental</strong> for what’s coming next.</li>
  <li>After a while, you come back to your writing to reiterate for further <strong>simplification</strong>, which takes us back to step <strong>[1]</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially when the language that you are writing is not your native language, the post-processing process can become harder.</p>

<p>To ease the pain of this process a bit, I use the <strong><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" title="Hemingway: Makes your writing bold and clean.">Hemingway Editor</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" title="Grammarly: Mistake-free writing.">Grammarly</a></strong> service — They are excellent tools that should be in any writer’s arsenal.</p>

<h2 id="other-editors-that-ive-tried-and-failed">Other Editors That I’ve Tried (<em>and Failed</em>)</h2>

<p>With all these tweaks, <strong><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">atom</a></strong> is an editor that I can type in for eternity.</p>

<p>Coming to this decision, however, was not easy:</p>

<p>I’ve tried a horde of editors including <strong><a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/" title="Ulysses makes writing fun and productive.">Ulysses</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://ia.net/writer/mac" title="A quintessential writing machine for Mac">IA Writer</a></strong>, and many more.</p>

<p>Next, I’ll look into a few of them, and describe why they were not a fit for me.</p>

<h3 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h3>

<p>The problem with <em><a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/" title="Ulysses makes writing fun and productive.">Ulysses</a></em> was that it was not creating pure markdown, and it was messing with my formatting <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="ia-writer">IA Writer</h3>

<p>The problem with <em><a href="https://ia.net/writer/mac" title="A quintessential writing machine for Mac">IA Writer</a></em> was the lack of a “<em>project workspace</em>” concept:</p>

<p>I don’t write a single article all the time: Sometimes I jump through files, editing here and there and everywhere. That’s especially true if I’m dealing with the manuscripts of a book, for instance.</p>

<p>I’d like to get a <em>file tree</em> handy <strong>when</strong> I need it. And want it to be out of my sight when I’m not interested in it. — With atom, it’s as easy as typing <strong>CMD-K CMD-B</strong> to toggle the file tree in an out of your way.</p>

<h3 id="first-draft">First Draft</h3>

<p>There one last editor that I’d like to mention: <strong><a href="http://www.96problems.com/first-draft/">first draft</a></strong>.</p>

<p>It is <strong>conceptually</strong> a wonderful idea, with terrible execution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of performance renders the editor totally unusable for large articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s why:</p>

<p>My average typing rate is around <em>70 words per minute</em>, and when I try to write that fast in <em><a href="http://www.96problems.com/first-draft/">first draft</a></em>, the application lags <strong>several words</strong> behind before it freezes to death.</p>

<p>This means that if I make a typo and hit <strong>backspace</strong>, for instance, I’ll have to wait for a few seconds until the editor catches up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of November 2015, <em><a href="http://www.96problems.com/first-draft/">first draft</a></em> is far from being product-quality. — If you plan to purchase it, keep that in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="you-dont-cut-out-features-for-the-sake-of-usability">You Don’t Cut Out Features for the Sake of <strong>Usability</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Good UX</em> is hiding features that the user may not need; it is <strong>not</strong> removing critical features and calling it “<em>minimalism</em>”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All these so called “<em>minimalistic</em>” editors don’t give a damn about your needs as a pro user.</p>

<p>If writing is part of your life, then you’ll at least want your editor to give some additional options, even if they are hidden behind menus or configuration files.</p>

<p>Here are my top three needs in an editor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I cannot live without a three-way <strong>split view</strong>.</li>
  <li>I will <strong>absolutely</strong> want to control the <strong>typography</strong> and the <strong>color scheme</strong> of my editor.</li>
  <li>I will want my <em>file tree</em>, and a <em>tabbed interface</em>, when I need it and get rid of them when I don’t (<em>with <a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">atom</a> you can remove the tabs entirely from your view if you want to</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these “<em>hassle-free writing applications</em>” disallow you to change almost any setting, including the type of the font, the size of the font, the color scheme.</p>

<p>Want a split view? Forget about it. You will have to type in a single big virtual sheet of paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are lucky, you can get some kind of a monotype font, and a darker page.</p>

  <p>And that’s all there is as configurability gets.</p>

  <p>You would not even be able to change the font face or font size.</p>

  <p>That’s insane!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘nuff complaining. Let’s move on, shall we? Well, before that…</p>

<h2 id="thinking-about-using-a-cloud-editor">Thinking About Using a Cloud Editor?</h2>

<p>I would love to use a cloud-based editor such as <strong><a href="https://c9.io/" title="Cloud9 IDE">Cloud9 IDE</a></strong> to make my workflow even more streamlined. With its <strong><a href="https://docs.c9.io/docs/running-your-own-ssh-workspace">SSH Workspaces</a></strong>, I would be working on my server, <strong>as if</strong> the files are on my laptop.</p>

<p>There’s one <em>itsy bitsy</em> problem, yet:</p>

<p><strong>Mobile internet connectivity in the Silicon Valley sucks donkey’s toenails</strong>.</p>

<p>It sucks to such extent that even the <strong><a href="https://c9.io/" title="Cloud9 IDE">Cloud9 IDE</a></strong>’s offline mode can’t help you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are <strong>on the go</strong> in the Valley, you will need an actual editor that does not require Internet connectivity to initialize itself.</p>

  <p>In the valley, <strong>the cloud</strong>, should be renamed as <strong>the fog</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I may retry cloudifying all my things three years from now maybe.</p>

<p><strong>I’m done with “<em>cloud editing</em>” for now</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-clickety-clack">The <strong>Clickety Clack</strong></h2>

<p>The least favor you can do to yourself as a writer is to get a <strong><a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/" title="One of the best.">decent mechanical keyboard</a></strong>.</p>

<p>And <strong><a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/" title="One of the best.">Das Keyboard</a></strong> is one of the best you’ll find – It’s worth every dime.</p>

<p><a href="https://o2js.com/images/das_keyboard.jpg"><img src="https://o2js.com/images/das_keyboard.jpg" title="Das Keyboard: One of the best keyboards that you can get" class="centered" /></a></p>

<h2 id="jekyll-and-typography"><strong>Jekyll</strong> and Typography</h2>

<p>Mentally stable individuals do not take notice of proper typographic punctuation. I’m not one of them. — For example, when I encounter a street sign reading <code>John's Place</code> instead of <code>John’s Place</code>, I throw a tantrum.</p>

<p>Why is this such a big deal? Because <strong>typography matters</strong>. — At least it matters to <em>me</em>. And I know there are <strong>lucky</strong> people out there who can live without caring about <strong>typography</strong> too much <strong>:)</strong>.</p>

<p>Luckily, <strong>Jekyll</strong> <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org/rdoc/Kramdown/Options.html" title="Kramdown">supports typographic substitutions</a> out of the box.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>That made me decide that I’m using <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> as my blogging platform of choice and using <strong><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom — The Editor">atom</a></strong> as my editor.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-jekyll">Setting Up <strong>Jekyll</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><img src="/images/jekyll.png" title="Jekyll" class="centered" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> is a tool that helps to generate static web content a breeze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> is especially a great fit for blogs: <strong>Blogs are first class citizens</strong> in <strong>Jekyll</strong>.</p>

<p>To use <strong>Jekyll</strong>, you will need to have <strong><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" title="Download Ruby">Ruby</a></strong> installed. If you don’t have <strong>Ruby</strong> on your system, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" title="Download Ruby">go ahead, and install the most recent one from rubylang.org</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the uber-nerds out there: You can install <strong>Ruby</strong> via <strong><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv" title="A better way to install ruby.">rbenv</a></strong> too. <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Why-rbenv%3F" title="Why rbenv?">And there are good reasons to do so</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> is properly set up, the only thing you have to do to write a blog post is to create a markdown file under <strong>_posts</strong> folder:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">ls _posts/
2015-02-10-writing-has-never-been-easier.md</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>I won’t explain how to set up a <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> website in detail, as it is <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/" title="Jekyll Documentation">explained well on their website</a>. — Just follow the examples there and you’ll be a <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> master in no time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-server-setup">The Server Setup</h2>

<p>Currently, my new <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Not your daddy's static site generator.">Jekyll</a></strong> sites stays under <strong>/var/www/SRC</strong>.</p>

<p>I know, it’s not an ideal place to put source code into, yet it does the job.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the security freaks out there thinking that the source folder is accessible via the Internet:</p>

  <p>Well, yes; <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com-v2" title="o2js.com new version">and the code is open source anyway</a>, so it’s not a big deal.</p>

  <p>And even if it is, we can always restrict access to that folder via <strong>nginx.conf</strong>.</p>

<p>While we’re at that, here’s how things are currently mapped in <strong>nginx.conf</strong> for reference:</p>

<h2 id="publishing-articles">Publishing Articles</h2>

<p>Now let’s publish stuff:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">jekyll build --config _config.yml<span class="p">;</span>
rsync -a _site/ /var/www<span class="p">;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>And voila! The blog post that I’ve just edited is live.</p>

<h2 id="automating-the-publish-flow">Automating the Publish Flow</h2>

<p>To automate things further I’ve created a little script:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">watch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">&#39;chokidar&#39;</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">watch</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">GLOB</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">join</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">__dirname</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/path/to/posts/**/*.md&#39;</span> <span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">watch</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">GLOB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{}</span> <span class="p">)</span>

      <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">child</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">spawn</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">PUBLISH_CMD</span> <span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="nx">child</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">stderr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">&#39;data&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">chunk</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Where <strong>./publish.sh</strong> is:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="err">#</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="err">/bin/bash</span>
<span class="nx">cd</span> <span class="p">..;</span>
<span class="nx">jekyll</span> <span class="nx">build</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nx">config</span> <span class="nx">_config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">yml</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">rsync</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">_site</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="err">/var/www</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="wait-my-files-are-not-in-the-server-yet">Wait! My Files Are Not In The Server Yet</h2>

<p>The publish script works properly on the server; however, I still have to move the changed files from my laptop the th server.</p>

<p>I’d want to do that as hassle-free as possible.</p>

<p>Luckily, it’s just a one-liner to do so:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c"># this requires an `IdentityFile &quot;~/path/to/your/server.pem&quot;` line in ~/.ssh/config</span>
rsync -a /Users/volkan/Desktop/o2js.com-v2/_posts/ <span class="se">\</span>
ubuntu@volkan.io:/var/www/o2js.com/SRC/o2js.com-v2/_posts/</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the watcher script is also running, whenever I <code>rsync</code> my changes to the server, they will be immediately published, and will be live in no time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I even use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-auto-refresh/kkhjakkgopekjlempoplnjclgedabddk?hl=en" title="crx-refresh extension">a nice little chrome extension</a> to auto-refresh the recent version of the article that I just published.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-livereload">Configuring LiveReload</h2>

<p>I also configured <strong><a href="http://livereload.com/" title="A happy land where browsers don't need a refresh button.">LiveReload</a></strong> on my laptop to run this <code>rsync</code> command whenever I save the articles’ markdown files.</p>

<p><a href="https://o2js.com/images/prepublish.png"><img src="https://o2js.com/images/prepublish.png" title="Configuring LiveReload to run a custom command" class="centered" /></a></p>

<h2 id="everything-is-streamlined-now">Everything is Streamlined Now</h2>

<p>This way everything will be automated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I save the markdown file on my laptop,</li>
  <li><a href="http://livereload.com/" title="A happy land where browsers don't need a refresh button.">LiveReload</a> will trigger an <code>rsync</code> script that pushes the changed files to the server,</li>
  <li>A watcher on the server will detect this change and <strong>republish</strong> the blog,</li>
  <li>After the publish process, the article will immediately go live,</li>
  <li>The web browser that I’m peeking at, on my laptop, will refresh itself, and then I’ll see the updated article.</li>
</ul>

<p>And during this flow, I won’t have to tap a single button. All I will be doing is writing, and saving (<em>by typing <strong>CMD+S</strong>, which is also typing <strong>:)</strong></em>)</p>

<p>Now writing is as easy as firing up an editor, and… well… writing.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-setup-for-the-ipad">Bonus: Setup for the <strong>iPad</strong></h2>

<p>Writing on the tablet is not easy.</p>

<p>I use it as a last resort, and honestly I don’t write too much on the tablet.</p>

<p>When I find myself have to write on iPad, I use a combination of</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://panic.com/dietcoda/" title="Diet Coda">Diet Coda</a></strong>,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/" title="Textastic">Textastic</a></strong>,</li>
  <li>And <strong><a href="https://panic.com/prompt/" title="Prompt">Prompt</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>They get the job done pretty well.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That was a quick overview of how I came up with a <strong>newer</strong> and <strong>better</strong> writing workflow.</p>

<p>This new flow made my writing life easier; hope you find it useful too.</p>

<p>Until next time…</p>

<p><strong>May the source be with you</strong>!</p>
