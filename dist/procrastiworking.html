<p>What is the most important asset that will help you achieve your ultimate goal in life?</p>
<p>It is not money, neither is it time; it is <strong>focus</strong>.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>When what you do is aligned with your highest priorities, you will have less stress, and you will be able to claim inner peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Paralysis By Analysis</h3>
<p>More often than not, your top priorities, your values, your aspirations, and your objectives are <strong>obscured</strong> by competing demands on <strong>your</strong> <em>time</em> and <em>attention</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel, when you have so much to do, and you don&#39;t know which one to start with? – Let me give you a hint: &quot;<strong>instant stress</strong>&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A moderate level of stress can be motivating, when not managed well, however, it can <strong>paralyze</strong> you instead. To overcome this <strong>paralysis by analysis</strong>, you will need to <strong>selectively eliminate</strong> things.</p>
<p>Let me tell you more about my story, to put things into perspective:</p>
<h3>It&#39;s Projects Everywhere!</h3>
<p>Aside from my day-to-day job, I have a lot of side-projects to deal with. 
And when I &quot;projects&quot;, I mean projects <a href="http://www.gtdtimes.com/2010/02/15/managing-projects-tips-from-david-allen/">in the GTD sense</a>. </p>
<p>Here are just a select few of my mid-to-long-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/linkibol">Linkibol</a>: A way to parse long stream of text including links;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/o2.js">o2.js</a>: A JavaScript framework in the middle of a rewrite;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/JFDI">JFDI</a>: An efficient way to <strong>get $#!% done</strong>;</li>
<li><a href="http://o2js.com/o2js-com-v2---a-new-hope">Rewriting all of my articles</a>;</li>
<li>Optimizing this blog you&#39;re reading, for speed and performance;</li>
<li>I have an ever-growing list of technical reading, podcasts to listen to, and videos to watch;</li>
<li>This blog is also a <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com">&quot;work in progress&quot; open source project</a> that I plan to convert into an easy to publish <strong>static blogging application</strong>;</li>
<li>I have friends and colleagues who want my help on their awesomest startup idea, which is &quot;<em>the next big thing</em>&quot; according to them;</li>
<li>I try to collaborate and add value to the developer community in various online groups, forums, and discussions;</li>
<li>I will have to prepare to present at a couple of tech-talks, within the following few months;</li>
<li>Last, but not the least, I have to finalize <a href="http://o2js.com/interview-questions">my book</a>, in less than a month.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure if you are a reader of this article, your situation is similar (<em>if not worse</em>) to mine. – What I will be sharing here is not rocket science; it&#39;s common sense; and it helped me <strong>regain</strong> my <strong>inner peace</strong>, so can it help you too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is just tip of the iceberg, I can add more items to the above this list… like… forever. These are a fraction of my personal development <strong>liabilities</strong>. And my assets (<em>i.e. my available free time</em>) are <strong>scarce</strong>, to say the least. </p>
<h3>Jedi Mind Tricks</h3>
<p>You know what? We are extremely skillful in deceiving ourselves: </p>
<p>It is incredibly easy to keep yourself &quot;<em>busy</em>&quot; with unimportant things that are <strong>not</strong> aligned with your goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing actual work is hard; and it will take a very long time for you to see your efforts pay off. Whereas doing things that disguise themselves as work gives instant satisfaction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s exceptionally relieving to <strong>re-re-re-organize</strong> your ever-growing to-do list. And, of course, you will feel extremely satisfied when you reach to &quot;<strong><a href="http://inboxzero.com/">inbox zero</a></strong>&quot; after sifting all of your e-mails for three hours. </p>
<p>The problem with that is; all of those micro-management tasks give you a <strong>false</strong> sense of achievement. More often than not, it&#39;s your mind creating an illusion of achievement, so that it can avoid doing actual stuff as long as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like eating Halloween candies: They are delicious, they give you a sense of satisfaction, and they are of zero use to you. Besides, they may even be harmful on the long run <strong>;)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>When In Doubt, Do It Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Being to father of a 16 month old, attention seeking cute little daughter; I find myself lucky if I can spare <strong>one hour of uninterrupted time</strong> per day. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a>? Forget about it! 
If you have kids, you will be distracted at least eight times during a single pomodoro!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I constantly have a <em>too little time</em> versus <em>too much things to do</em> dilemma, which from time to time creates additional <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
<p>So is there a solution out of this feeling of weight on your shoulders?<br>
Yes, there is. </p>
<p>Is it easy, and applicable?<br> 
<strong>Absolutely</strong>!</p>
<p>And before diving into that, let&#39;s see what &quot;time management&quot; <strong>isn&#39;t</strong>:</p>
<h3>&quot;<em>Time Management</em>&quot; is a Luxury for Those Who Have Time</h3>
<p>For the last ten years, I&#39;ve read a lot of productivity books and articles, and I&#39;ve tried techniques like <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a>, <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a>, <a href="http://dontbreakthechain.com/what">&quot;don&#39;t break the chain&quot; technique</a>,  and <a href="http://99u.com/category/action-method">the action method</a>. I even have developed <a href="https://gist.github.com/v0lkan/2694911">my own methodology of getting stuff done</a>. </p>
<p>I have tried hundreds of productivity software, as well. I&#39;m not just testing the waters; I&#39;ve fallen from the productivity bandwagon, and put myself back on track over and over again.</p>
<p>And here is what I&#39;ve found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You cannot manage time</strong>; you can only prevent time from managing you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>time management</strong> is <strong>not</strong> getting lots of stuff done as quickly as possible. What is more important, in deed, is making sure that you are working on the <strong>right things</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given <strong>time management is an illusion</strong> to make you feel that you are in control; the only way to get important stuff done is to <strong>procrastiwork</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Procrasti… what?!</p>
<h3>Procrastiworking</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procrastiworking</strong> (n): Delaying stuff to <strong>tomorrow</strong>, to do more stuff <strong>today</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m an engineer. So my job involves analyzing requirements, balancing resources, evaluating <strong>trade-off</strong>s and <strong>sacrificing</strong> to meet <strong>constraints</strong>.</p>
<p>I apply the same approach to my personal projects, too. Namely, I work on the things that will make a big impact, and delay the rest to tomorrow.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to pick the most important things that will give the greatest outcome, in the shortest amount of time, and only work on them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you feel like you are doing the right thing; you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&#39;s not only me who thinks like that. Here&#39;s what <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html">Jeff Attwood has to say</a> on the subject matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> If you can&#39;t wake up every day and, using your 100% original equipment God-given organic brain, come up with the three most important things you need to do that day – then you should seriously work on fixing that. I don&#39;t mean install another app, or read more productivity blogs and books. You have to figure out what&#39;s important to you and what motivates you; ask yourself why that stuff isn&#39;t gnawing at you enough to make you get it done. Fix that. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pick Your Top Three</h3>
<p>Here are my top three things on my plate, right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing <a href="http://o2js.com/interview-questions">my book on <strong>JavaScript Interview Questions</strong></a>,</li>
<li>Working on <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/JFDI"><strong>JFDI</strong></a>,</li>
<li>And <strong>writing</strong> a blog post <em>every other week</em> <a href="http://o2js.com/o2js-com-v2---a-new-hope">to complete this list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know why, and I&#39;ve found out that <strong>there is some magic in the number three</strong>: Focusing on less feels like you are losing control; and having more than three things to consider at a time feels like an <strong>overburden</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s why these things are the &quot;<strong>top three</strong>&quot; in my list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/JFDI">JFDI</a> is aligned with my <strong>procrastiworking</strong> methodology, so developing it will also formalize my system of productivity; and since it&#39;s a command-line application written in <strong>Node.JS</strong>, it&#39;s really fun to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Writing</strong> (<em>be it a book, or a blog post</em>) is always an <strong>educational adventure</strong>: To write good content, you will have to read stuff, watch videos; <strong>consume more content</strong>. So it is be hitting multiple birds with one stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, I can slice either of these goals into one-hour time slots. For instance, I can draft an article for an hour, and then continue from where I left, the next day.</p>
<p>I can even draft blog post, during my daily train commutes (**which I am doing right now, as I am typing these lines in my <a href="http://baz.com">markdown editor</a>)</p>
<h3>Doesn&#39;t This Make <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/JFDI">JFDI</a> Redundant?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. </p>
<p>It all depends on how you use the system: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>JFDI</strong> program uses two lists (the <strong>today</strong> queue, and the <strong>tomorrow</strong> queue) to manage your goals. And you can easily defer a goal in your <strong>today</strong> queue, to <strong>tomorrow</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/JFDI/blob/master/README.md">You can read the project&#39; README file</a>, for more information on how this works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the course of the day, you will have a lot of small errands (like &quot;make sure you talk to Sarah&quot;, &quot;read this article tonight&quot;, &quot;send an e-mail to the book&#39;s editors before noon&quot;, &quot;remember the milk&quot;… – none of these goals would be &quot;<em>rocket surgery</em>&quot; per se). </p>
<p>And that&#39;s where <strong>JFDI</strong> comes into play: Keeping a queue for <strong>today</strong>&#39;s goals, and deferring stuff that do not need to be done today, to <strong>tomorrow</strong> is a really simple, yet elegant idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an item on my <strong>today</strong> queue bothers me, I immediately defer it; and don&#39;t think about it until I find some time to reflect upon my <strong>tomorrow</strong> queue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How About You?</h3>
<p>Do you have time-management techniques or tricks that work for you?<br> 
How do they work for you?<br> 
I&#39;d love to learn.</p>
