<p>So the thing is, I used cloud9.io and other stuff only to realiz that if I’m on a Mac environment clodifying my life
might be easier than that.</p>

<p>Webstorm did not work well, it tried to index remote files like crazy and it caused problems over SSH.</p>

<p>I am using “Luxi Mono” as a font, it’s one of the rares serif fixed-width fonts; it gives the best of both worlds, and it’s doing its job really well.</p>

<p>For instance, I can edit this files as if they are on my local file system (tehre are open source alternatives;
however, I choose to use Transmit — it is awesome, worth every penny)</p>

<p>So when I edit something it’s already live.</p>

<p>One good thing is I don’t care about typography, as Jekyll is handling that for me.</p>

<p>Sometimes saving can be slow. that’s due to changing network etc I guess.</p>

<p>I also can ssh that’s no big deal.</p>

<p>On tablet I use panic coda, it has terminal, it has a decent editor, and it works brilliantly. — I don’t understand
 all the negative reviews on the app store; it does its job well.</p>

<p>One problem is that what I write will not be typographically accurate. — Is that a problem? Not really. Since jekyll already handles that, it’s not a big issue. — A bigger issue is</p>

<p>So how do I solve my needs?</p>

<p>operating system?</p>

<p>Learning to be frugal.</p>

<p>Apple keyboard is “beautiful” and I don’t need to be a master typist anyway; and it also leaves a lot of space on my dekstop. — That should be the future: I mean, the future is less cluttered, less clunky. — The keyboards with tactile feedback, no matter how beautiful they are, are a thing of the past.</p>

<p>And I don’t think it affects my typing speed that much anyways.</p>

<p>I still can type on the keyboard. —</p>

<p>… And if it’s “Apple” I am sure they have thought about the best layout, the ideal key spacing, why 4 degrees inclination is the best etc etc before even coming up with their initial prototype. — Because they designed these Apple Wireless Keyboards when Steve Jobs was alive.</p>

<p>```
I really liked this luxi mono font;
It’s serif; so it’s more readable.
And and it’s elegant.
It needs a little extra line height; however, I can live with it :)</p>

<p>```</p>
